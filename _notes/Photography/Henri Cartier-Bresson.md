> To take a photograph is to align the head, the eye and the heart. It's a way of life

### The basics
* Black and White only 
* Leica 35 mm. But I haven't been born rich so far, so for now I'll use an old Sony Cybershot
* Shutter speed between 1/60 and 1/250. Mostly 1/125
* Apperture wide, around f2.8 to 5.6
* Focus in shapes and forms
	* Leading lines
	* Rule of thirds 
	* Rule of odds
	* Frame within a frame
	* Golden ratio
* No cropping
* No flash
* The decisive moment ðŸ–¤
