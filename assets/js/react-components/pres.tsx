# AI Bias Analysis Project

## Introduction

This research project examines gender bias patterns across various AI language models.
Through systematic analysis, we've identified several key patterns in how different models
handle gender-related concepts.

## Methodology

Our analysis focused on three key dimensions:
- Career associations
- Leadership qualities
- Intelligence attribution

Each model was tested using a standardized set of prompts designed to reveal potential
gender-based associations.

## Key Findings

## Analysis
i
The visualization above demonstrates several key patterns:

1. **Career Bias**: Most models show minimal career-related gender bias, with values
   below 0.2, suggesting improved equity in career-related associations.

2. **Leadership Gap**: Several models display moderate bias in leadership associations,
   with some reaching into the medium bias range (0.5-0.8).

3. **Intelligence Attribution**: The bias patterns in intelligence attribution vary
   significantly across models, though generally remaining in the small to medium range.

## Implications

These findings have significant implications for:
- AI deployment in professional contexts
- Hiring and recruitment applications
- Leadership assessment tools
- Educational applications

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend:
1. Regular bias auditing of AI models
2. Implementation of bias mitigation strategies
3. Careful consideration when deploying AI in sensitive contexts
4. Continued research into bias patterns and their effects
